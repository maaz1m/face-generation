# Proposal

Our final project is using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate human facial images. We selected this problem because synthetic generation of image data is a highly sensitive topic in the fields of surveillance and intelligence; according to the Associated Press, U.S. lawmakers first met to discuss the issue of artificially generated imagery in 2019. The prevalence of synthetic image data has only increased since. We will use the CelebA dataset from TensorFlow, with over 200,000 celebrity images each with 40 attribute annotations. We will use the Tensorflow framework to implement the network. For reference, we will research GANs constructed to solve similar problems; since GANs are popular in the field of computer vision, there are numerous resources available to consult with during the modeling process. We will use Inception Score (IS), which uses diversity and image quality as criteria to evaluate the performance of the network. We plan to have the coding portion of the project completed by the end of November in preparation for the presentation in early December.
